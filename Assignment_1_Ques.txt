1. Write a program to print all perfect squares between 1 and N (input).

Input: N (int)
Output: 1, 4, 9, ... 

2. Find the LCM of two integers. Try to make the solution as efficient as possible.

Input: num1 (int), num1 (int)
Output: LCM (int).

3. You need to paint the walls and roof of a room that is shaped as a regular polygon with n sides, and side length, s. Find the cost of painting if it costs Rs. 12 to apply 1 coat of paint to 1 sq.meter of wall/roof, and you need to apply k coats of paint. Input units are in meters.

Input: number of sides (int), length of 1 side (float), height of the room (float)
Output: cost of painting (float with two decimal precision).

4. You are tasked with designing and building astronomical observatories for educational institutions. The observatories are circular shaped buildings with a hemispherical dome at the top. You are given the height, h, of the building measured from the ground to the apex of the dome and the radius, r or the building. Assuming that the dome height is at-most half of the total height of the building and that you ideally want a complete hemi-spherical dome, find the volume of the building.

Input: height (float), radius (float)
Output: volume (float with two decimal precision).

5. For the above observatory, you decided to build a buckyball (truncated icosahedron) structure for the dome. Compute the amount of fabric required to cover the dome. You may assume that the  area is half that of the buckyball area.

Input: radius (float in meters)
Output: area (float with two decimal precision in sq. meters).
